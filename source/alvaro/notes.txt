Quantum Properties: Discretization-energy has levels, but no  nuance just discrete values. Because of this,
 we can either use quantum objects as 0 or 1 the building blocks of computing. Superposition. Interference- the 
 quantum states of objects can add up or cancel out. Entanglement- it doesn’t matter the distance, particles 
 affect each other. Each quantum object affect each other.
What makes quantum possible? Anything that can be measured consistently in a particle is called a particle property.
 Otherwise it would be waves. What is double slit experiment? Just shows interference of waves. Also shows 
 difference between waves and particles, particles just pass through. We can think of qubits both as waves and 
 particles.
Superposition can also happen with waves by combining the waves.
Discretization with waves because quantum objects are confined, they are molded into to different shapes/energies.
 Confinement can exist naturally or artificially.
Ket notation shows state of qubits. To visually see a qubit state use bloch sphere, but can’t see entanglement.
Quantum gates are the knobs that manipulate the qubits. From logic gates. Operation of gates can be visualized 
operations on the bloch sphere.

A superposition can have equal or unequal state being affected. The closer to states 0 or 1 the state of quantum object is the line is the more it is influenced.
The Z gate changes the 1 state to be negative but that doesn’t affect where the sate lies.
