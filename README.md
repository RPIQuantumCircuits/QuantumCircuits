# QuantumCircuits
A GUI-based Quantum Circuit Simulator

Introduction: 
   Quantum Computers represent promise in terms of physical simulation and for a handful of more general problems and a fundamental shift in how computation as a whole is viewed. However, when trying to learn quantum computing, one is either given the choice of an inflexible framework locked into one paradigm of quantum computation with a GUI or a flexible one with significant syntaxual overhead. In either case, building application for quantum computers are a secondary consideration to the primary goal of quantum simulation. QuantumCircuits aims to change this by giving students and professors alike access to an open-source learning software prioritizing 1) applications, 2) simplicity, 3) exposure, and 4) extendability.
   
Current Feature Set:
  1) Local CPU/GPU Hamiltonian/Feynman-like Simulation Capacities
  2) Friendly drag and drop GUI interface
  3) Ability to save and load ".qc" files
  5) Use Xanadu's Photonic Quantum Computer to run circuit
  6) Use IBM's Quantum Computers to run circuit
  7) Allows QUBO specification to be run on DWave's Quantum Annealer
  8) Recommends modifications to Standard Gate-Model quantum computing circuits
